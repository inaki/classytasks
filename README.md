ClassyTasks
===========

This app was designed and developed in **CrossHack to Education**, by Code for America people. The idea behind this is to have a technology tool for **teachers** and **parents** to work together
for everything that is needed during the regular school year.

## How does this works?
1. Teacher creates the class group (students and their parents info).
2. Teacher create tasks or needs for the classroom or class event.
3. Parents can see in the app the tasks or needs.
4. Parents select the ones they can do or contribute.
5. And the task or need go to pending area till is done.

## What technologies we are using?
- Twitter Bootstrap
- AngulaJS
- Ruby on Rails (this part is not merge yet in the project).


## notes
- We think is important that teacher and parents work together
- This creates more opportunities to parents to help.
-  ** We want to make easier for people to help! **
